Thanks for the detailed update — and you're almost there!

### ✅ Good News:

You've **successfully authenticated via SSH** as:

```
Hi binodmohapatradevops-lang! You've successfully authenticated...
```

That means your SSH key is working **and correctly linked to the right GitHub account** (`binodmohapatradevops-lang`).

---

### ❌ Bad News:

You're **still pushing over HTTPS** instead of SSH.

That’s why Git is **still trying to use `DevopsPractice95`**, and you’re seeing this error:

```
remote: Permission to binodmohapatradevops-lang/javaproject.git denied to DevopsPractice95.
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/binodmohapatradevops-lang/javaproject.git/': The requested URL returned error: 403
```

---

## 🛠️ Final Fix: Update the Remote URL to SSH

You’re still pushing to:

```
https://github.com/binodmohapatradevops-lang/javaproject.git
```

We need to switch it to the **SSH version**:

```bash
git@github.com:binodmohapatradevops-lang/javaproject.git
```

---

### ✅ Step-by-Step

#### 🔄 1. Change Remote URL to SSH:

```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:binodmohapatradevops-lang/javaproject.git
```

#### 🔍 2. Confirm the change:

```bash
git remote -v
```

It should now show:

```
origin  git@github.com:binodmohapatradevops-lang/javaproject.git (fetch)
origin  git@github.com:binodmohapatradevops-lang/javaproject.git (push)
```

#### 🚀 3. Now push:

```bash
git push origin main
```

---

That should succeed now since:

* You're authenticated via SSH as `binodmohapatradevops-lang`
* You're pushing over the correct SSH connection

---

Let me know if the push succeeds — or if you'd like to set up multiple account support via `~/.ssh/config`.
